    "\n",
    "Ans:In Python, memory management is handled automatically by the Python interpreter, using a technique known as garbage collection. This means that the programmer does not need to worry about memory allocation or deallocation, and can focus on writing code without worrying about low-level memory management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses a combination of reference counting and a garbage collector to manage memory. Reference counting is a technique where the interpreter keeps track of the number of references to each object, and when an object's reference count drops to zero, it is immediately deallocated. This means that objects are deallocated as soon as they are no longer needed, which helps to prevent memory leaks and improve performance."
